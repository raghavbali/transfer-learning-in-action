[*__"Transfer Learning in Action"__*](https://www.manning.com/books/transfer-learning-in-action?utm_source=bali&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_sarkar_transfer_6_18_21&a_aid=bali&a_bid=0ea74335) teaches the fundamental concepts of _transfer learning_ and how you can easily apply them to your projects. It’s filled with insightful illustrations that demystify the latest research and make this cutting-edge technique easily accessible. You’ll start with the basics, gradually building your confidence and understanding until you’re ready to handle advanced techniques. Each chapter explores a different real-world application of transfer learning, such as image classification and style transfer, automatic question answering, and even speech recognition.

In Transfer Learning in Action you will learn:

+ Fundamental concepts of transfer learning
+ Real world applications of transfer learning
+ Improving performance of computer vision models with state-of-the-art pre-trained models
+ Transfer learning for natural language processing
+ Optimizing audio classification and generation
Leveraging TensorFlow-Hub, HuggingFace transformers, and other frameworks

Humans learn new things more easily when they build on existing related knowledge. Transfer learning applies this same principle to machine learning. This technique takes powerful pre-trained models and shares their existing knowledge to help improve new machine learning applications. The result is a massive performance boost to your models, especially when your training data is limited, unbalanced, or poorly annotated.

Transfer Learning in Action shows you how using pre-trained models can massively improve the accuracy and performance of your machine learning projects. Focused on the real-world applications of transfer learning, you’ll explore how to enhance everything from computer vision to natural language processing and beyond. Master hands-on techniques taken from the latest research, and discover how you can customize open source models for your specific needs.
